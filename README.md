 This project builds an intelligent interview assistant that conducts adaptive, AI-driven interviews. 
 By combining speech technology, NLP, and reinforcement learning, the system can: 
      - Understand candidate resumes and job descriptions.
      - Ask relevant, evolving questions.
      - Evaluate  answers in real time.
      - Learn from every session to become a more effective interviewer.
 Ultimately, it reduces human effort in the early stages of recruitment while maintaining personalization and adaptability
